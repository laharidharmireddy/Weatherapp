# Weatherap

The Weather-app is a web application that provides real-time weather information for a specified location. It utilizes the Open Weather-Map API to fetch weather data and displays it in a user-friendly interface. 

The Weather App is a simple project developed by using JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. The user can check the condition of the present-day climate probability and predict whether the day is a cloudy or sunny day. 

Users can search for a location by city name and receive detailed weather information, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions.
